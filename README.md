# Android-Based App for Algorithmic Trading
Robots can trade 24 hours per week, analyze changes
in quotes every fraction of a second, and make decisions much faster
than humans. With the emergence of crypto exchanges, where
trading takes place on weekends and at night, the relevance of bots
has increased even more. 
There are many trade bots available for
users, however, in many cases, the user either has no control over
the algorithm the bot is working on or the setup requires deep
knowledge and understanding of trading. My task is to create a
mobile application that will serve as a constructor for creating a bot,
as well as a platform for testing it on historical data or in a sandbox.
The goal of this project is to allow unskilled traders to try building
their own algorithms, test them, and apply them in practice using
their mobile phones.
